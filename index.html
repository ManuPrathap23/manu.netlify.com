            <H1>Hi, I am Manu Prathap. I am 20 years old living in Chennai, India.</H1>
            <h2>I am learning to make my own website</h3>
            <h3>So I want to tell you a little about myself...</h3>
            <h4> I am a final year engineering student from Velammal Engineering College, Anna University with a track record of 9.01 CGPA. Though I was a Biology student, I had developed a keen interest in programming quite early on and learnt coding from my brother. My interest in Mathematics combined with coding has allured me into Data Structures and Algorithms.

                I have been proactively solving problems on Leetcode which has augmented my coding skills. Out of many problems on Leetcode, few stood out to me because of how it was approached. Among those, my personal favorites are ‘Find All Numbers Disappeared’<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/"> click here</a> and ‘Number of Islands’ <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/solution/">click here</a>. The former problem  caught my attention because of the O(1) InPlace modification approach. Negating the numbers seen in the array and using the sign of each of the numbers for finding our missing numbers was a new method to me and it made me go crazy! I felt that this approach was way different from the conventional approach of solving this problem.
                
                I understand why the later problem is a standard interview question in most of the top tech companies as it really tests a candidate’s knowledge in Data Structures. When I tried solving this problem, I was initially stuck with the idea of solving it as a matrix question. Only after reading further about it I understood that it has more to do with graphs than simple matrix concepts. 
                
                Apart from that there were many concepts I was able to learn by solving leetcode. I learnt how ‘two pointers’ proved to be very efficient in many arrays, strings and list problems. One of my favorite usage was the ‘Hare and tortoise pointers’ to check if there is a cycle in the given Linked List. I was able to trace how DFS works through problems like Path Sum, where you have to determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. One of many topics I find intriguing is Dynamic Programming for which Maximum Subarray is a very good example. I learnt how DP can be implemented through Kadane’s Algorithm to solve the above mentioned problem efficiently. I used to implement brute force methods for problems like ‘Contain Duplicates’ and for problems where you need to keep a record of already seen data. But after solving many related problems, I became aware of HashSet and Hashtable, which makes the code more efficient and straight-forward.
                
                I have worked as part of a group to implement Image Steganography out of our own initiative. We implemented components that handle image data in raw format and embeds the secret data into image pixels. During the course of this project, when the question arose as to which programming language needs to be used, we were able to unanimously come to the conclusion of using Python. This is because it has many in-built libraries which are meant for Image processing. 

                My other project was ‘To-Do List Application’ where I created a web app which had features to create, save and update day to day to-do lists. I came up with this idea because I like to work with a schedule, which allows me to be more organized.  

Apart from my academic capabilities, I have been practicing Taekwondo since I was 7 years old. I have a Silver medal in District level and Bronze medal in State level tournaments. During that State level tournament, there was a time when I had to lose 11 pounds, to compete in my required weight category. I successfully came down 5 kgs within 2 hours by rigorous running to an extent where I was extremely dehydrated. My passion for Taekwondo continues and it is my solace during hard times. 

I hope I have been able to paint a picture of who I am.
